# Problems, limitations of existing languages

## C++ (including modern standards)
- Does not enforce safety like Rust does.
- Huge existing codebases mean it's always hard to use the latest and greatest standard.

## Haskell
- Performance issues. Optimized code requires lots of workarounds and "messing" up the code.
- Mandatory GC.
- Bad compiler performance.
- IDEs are in a bad state.

## Rust
- Generics is still lacking compared to C++ templates.
- Writing SIMD code is so-so.
- Bad compiler performance.
- IDE support is not as good as C++, and besides the IDEA plugin nothing works out of the box.

## Python
- Super slow!
- Dynamic typing.
- Mandatory GC.
