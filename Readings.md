### compile time garbage collection

### Data Flow Fusion
[Data Flow Fusion with Series Expressions in Haskell](http://repa.ouroborus.net/#DataFlowFusion)

### unified effectful and pure syntax
[Ben Lippmeier - An overview of the DDC compiler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QShfhs7nToI)

### existing ideas and implementations
- gpgpu languages / array languages:  futhark, repa
- multi-stage languages:              ber meta ocaml
- modern language design:             idris

languages to check
- ber meta ocaml
- idris (dependent type + partial evaluation + staged compilation + extendable syntax)
- futhark (it's written in haskell)

[holyjit](https://github.com/nbp/holyjit): this is also some kind of partial evaluation thing and I don't really understand it
