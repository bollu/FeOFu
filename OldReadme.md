First, we'd like to list the following:

1. Problems and limitations of existing programming languages that cause trouble in one or more setting either in developer experience, performance or other aspects.

2. Similar collection for APIs and/or libraries, specifically in the context of GPU and / or graphics APIs, like OpenGL, OpenCL, Vulkan, CUDA, SYCL, DirectX, but non limited to these.

3. General guidelines / features / expectations related to a possibly novel programming language (possibly overlap with some elements from point 1.)

4. Personal ideas or conclusions of specific experiments (real or thought) with languages or APIs.

Please explain any contributed thoughts in full sentences with examples if possible.
