## Parsing and Syntax related topics and resources

Main point: the parser / compiler must be designed with IDE support in mind, that is, for recompiling a project with only small, localized changes since the last build. Also, the parser / type checker / partial evaluator must be able to run on local parts of the code to support tooltips, completion, etc.
