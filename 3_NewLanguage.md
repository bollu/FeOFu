## Expectations, tips, features of a novel programming langauge
(please expand with reasoning)
- dependently typed
- partial evaluation = staging ; binding time inference
- prop universe to guarantee type erasure
- whole program compilation

- aligment ; experimental
- control over memory layout
- no GC or optional

## Things to discuss
- Indirect access: pointers / references how?
- Scoping, modules, objects
- Pure, impure, semi-pure functions and closures (important example: random number generators and I/O)
- Declarative compiler stage definitions via recursion schemes
- User defined stages / rewrite rules?
