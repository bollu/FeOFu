# Extend Haskell
- memory layout control
- expose strictness information in types (optional, with hole support)
- compiler with bidirectional code map ; source <-> machine code
- multi stage compilation with partial evaluation using binding time annotation with binding time inference support
- runtime profiling based optimisations ; ability to recompile code on the fly and migrate runtime data
- gpu graphics support based on lambdacube 3d graphics combinators
- gpu compute support based on obsidian combinators
- nested data parallel support based on nova language
- support to observe any value in arbitrary layer of the compilation pipeline ; including runtime thunks
- query language to collect runtime statistics ; ad-hoc selective debugger and profiler
